[Scott Hanselmen](https://twitter.com/shanselman) wrote a post titled _[Your words are wasted](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/your-words-are-wasted)._ It's a great point being made there, worth the read.

In the post, he talks about how if you post your content on other platforms, it's not really yours.

He quotes [Tim Bray](https://twitter.com/timbray), who I'll also quote here:

> Own your space on the Web, and _pay for it_. Extra effort, but otherwise you’re a sharecropper. -— [Tim Bray](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2012/08/18/Blogodammerung)

Well, here we go: home data center, [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), and more.

Join me as I go through my daily journey of struggling with under-documented technology, random ideas, and life in general.

Let's just hope I can keep this up!
