## New Beginnings

I'm a new engineer on the [DigitalOcean App Platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/?refcode=0759a4937a7a&utm_campaign=Referral_Invite&utm_medium=Referral_Program&utm_source=CopyPaste) team. I've spent the last 20 years writing C# code full-time. I've made the switch to [Go](https://go.dev/) and to be perfectly honest, I miss writing C#. You know that itch you have for doing something you love so much? Well, I've got to scratch that [.NET](https://dot.net) itch somehow while learning Golang and the amazingly capable App Platform product.

I figured I'd kill two birds with one stone and build a complex distributed system on top of App Platform.

This [series](/series/building-a-distributed-task-scheduler-on-digitalocean-app-platform) is going to document my journey of building a highly-available Task Scheduling system hosted on App Platform.

I've selected a very fancy name for the project: *Web Scheduler*. It's 100% open source, and can be found in the [repository](https://github.com/web-scheduler/web-scheduler) at GitHub.

## Scope

The Web Scheduler will be a highly-available, distributed, task-scheduling system allowing users to schedule tasks, one time, or recurring, that will use a variety of delivery mechanisms to send a signal and trigger *something* in a remote application.

### Scheduling Options

- **One-Time**: A task that will be executed once, at a specific time.
- **Recurring**: A task that will be executed at a specific interval (think [`crontab`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) capabilities).
  - Limit the recurrences to a specific number of times or run indefinitely.

### Delivery Mechanisms

I've listed a few below that were top of mind.

#### HTTP Webhook

- `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` HTTP verbs.
- Add ability to templatize the body of the request.
- Add additional headers to the request.
- Retry with exponential backoff.

#### WebSockets

- Send a message to a WebSocket endpoint.
- Retry with exponential backoff.

#### gRPC

- Send a message to a gRPC endpoint.
- Retry with exponential backoff.

#### Database

- Execute a query against a database.
- Support for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server initially.

#### Message Queues

- Send a message to a message queue.
- Support for RabbitMQ, Kafka, and Azure Service Bus initially.

#### Other

- Send an email.
- Send an SMS.
- Send a Slack message.
- Send a Discord message.

Sub-second delivery guarantees would be great 😊
